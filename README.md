# Purpose of this project

Here I create vairous angular-directives to use in other projects.
Some are very specific, some are general but they grow up in this playground, in this factory.

## Structure and setup

Each directory is devided in its own directory, the aim is to mimic a "component" structure.
The aim is to isolate each directory as its own entity.
